			<h3>Our Mission</h3>
			<p class="italic">High Country Venture invests in the most promising and innovative early stage companies in Colorado, working with passionate entrepreneurs to foster growth, transform markets and create long-term value.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="post">
			<h3>Beginnings</h3>
			<p>High Country Venture, LLC (HCV) was founded in 2005 by principals affiliated with the private investment company Tango. The principals at Tango have been investing together since 1998.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="post">
			<h3>Our Focus</h3>
			<p>HCV manages approximately $50mm in venture funds and invests primarily in the areas of life sciences (including biotechnology, diagnostics and medical devices) and internet technology. Nevertheless, we encourage all qualified businesses seeking capital to submit a business plan, regardless of the industry.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="post">
			<h3>More About Us</h3>
			<p>We are a venture capital firm that makes active investments in promising early-stage companies that have scalable, innovative technology. We frequently work with founders to develop the initial business plan, even prior to funding. We also tend to take an active role in our investments, particularly in the early stages when a low level of funding precludes extensive hiring of senior management or a large staff. Because of our own experience and background in starting and managing small companies, we feel comfortable in these roles.</p>
